In late May 2020 I was completely burnt out. After working over a decade in the
software engineering industry I was at a truly wonderful company with
amazing coworkers, but the world seemed to be falling apart around me. Every
night the news stories were brimming with growing COVID-19 numbers and
peaceful protests met with police violence. I felt like I wasn't helping
enough, so I quit my cushy software engineering job with the intention of
looking for a job in the nonprofit sector.

As I looked around I realized that many of the causes I supported didn't
necessarily need a full-time software developer, much less could afford one
at market rates. That didn't mean my skills weren't of use to them though,
so I decided the best way to use my abilities to make a positive impact
was to form Catshark Consulting. My aim is to provide digital expertise to
the nonprofit community at affordable rates and to leverage technology
to amplify their voice and mission.
