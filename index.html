        <p class="first">
        In late May 2020 I was completely burnt out. After working over a decade in the
        software engineering industry I was at a truly wonderful company with
        amazing coworkers, but the world seemed to be falling apart around me. Every
        night the news stories were brimming with growing COVID-19 numbers and
        peaceful protests met with police violence. I felt like I wasn't helping
        enough, so I quit my cushy software engineering job with the intention of
        looking for a job in the nonprofit sector.
        </p><p class="last">
        As I looked around I realized that many of the causes I supported didn't
        necessarily need a full-time software developer, much less could afford one
        at market rates. That didn't mean my skills weren't of use to them though,
        so I decided the best way to use my abilities to make a positive impact
        was to form Catshark Consulting. My aim is to provide digital expertise to
        the nonprofit community at affordable rates and to leverage technology
        to amplify their voice and mission.
