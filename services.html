<h4>Act as a technology translator</h4>
<p>A number of pre-existing solutions exist for technology challenges, but they are either marketed exclusively
    to other technology companies or are obscured behind industry specific jargon. I can help organizations
    find and implement these solutions, often for discounted rates or completely free of charge.</p>

<h4>Tell stories with data</h4>
<p>Organizing and making sense out of a giant mass of data can be intimidating. My skill set and experience enables me 
    to efficiently store, organize, and analyze data. I enable nonprofit organizations to tell the story they want 
    with the data they have.</p>

<h4>Provide simple, sustainable, custom solutions</h4> 
<p>Sometimes a unique piece of code needs to be developed to overcome a particular technical challenge. When I 
    create these solutions the goal is always to create something that the client can run on their own, for the 
    long-term, and without expert intervention or maintenance. This can include providing training and documentation
    for a client's existing team to utilize.</p>
